#Range 

# Write a recursive method, range, that takes a start and an end and returns an array of all numbers in that range, 
# exclusive. For example, range(1, 5) should return [1, 2, 3, 4]. If end < start, you can return an empty array.
# Write both a recursive and iterative version of sum of an array.

def range(start, last)
    
    return [] if  last < start    # base case 

   range(start, last - 1) + [last]

end 

p range(5, 10)


# Exponentiation
# Write two versions of exponent that use two different recursions:

# # this is math, not Ruby methods.

# # recursion 1
# exp(b, 0) = 1
# exp(b, n) = b * exp(b, n - 1)

# # recursion 2
# exp(b, 0) = 1
# exp(b, 1) = b
# exp(b, n) = exp(b, n / 2) ** 2             [for even n]
# exp(b, n) = b * (exp(b, (n - 1) / 2) ** 2) [for odd n]
# Note that for recursion 2, you will need to square the results of exp(b, n / 2) and (exp(b, (n - 1) / 2). Remember that you don't need to do anything special to square a number, just calculate the value and multiply it by itself. So don't cheat and use exponentiation in your solution.

# Suggestion: Break the methods down into parts. For more information check out the Breaking Methods Into Parts reading in the sidebar.

# Suggestion 2: Try walking through your code with Simple Examples.

# If the n == 256, about how many nested recursive steps will we run in the first case?

# How deep will we need to recurse for the second? Keep in mind that the first reduces the 
# exponent by one for each recursion, while the second reduces it by half.

# In addition to testing your methods by running the code, try the following exercise:

# On paper, write out the value of each variable for every line in the code:

# Write out what happens with base 0 and power 0 as inputs (should be easy). e.g., if you had run exp(0,0).
# Write out what happens for base 0 and power 1. e.g., if you had run exp(0,1).
# Write out what happens for base 1 and power 0.
# Write out what happens for base 1 and power 1.
# Write out what happens for base 1 and power 2.
# Write out what happens for base 2 and power 0.
# Write out what happens for base 2 and power 1.
# Write out what happens for base 2 and power 2.
# Make sure you can trace from the very beginning to the very end in these examples.

# How many examples do you need to walk through to be confident that it works?

# Deep dup
# The #dup method doesn't make a deep copy:

# robot_parts = [
#   ["nuts", "bolts", "washers"],
#   ["capacitors", "resistors", "inductors"]
# ]

# robot_parts_copy = robot_parts.dup

# # shouldn't modify robot_parts
# robot_parts_copy[1] << "LEDs"
# # but it does
# robot_parts[1] # => ["capacitors", "resistors", "inductors", "LEDs"]
# When you dup an Array, it creates a new array to hold the elements, but doesn't recursively dup any arrays contained therein. So the dup method creates one new array, but just copies over references to the original interior arrays.

# Sometimes you want a shallow dup and sometimes you want a deep dup. Ruby keeps things simple by giving you shallow dup, and letting you write deep dup yourself.

# Using recursion and the is_a? method, write an Array#deep_dup method that will perform a "deep" duplication of the interior arrays.

# Note: For simplicity's sake, you are only going to ensure the deep duplication of arrays. Don't worry about deep-duping (or regular-duping) other types of mutable objects (like strings, hashes, instances of custom classes, etc.), since this would require that you implement a deep dup method for each of those classes as well.

# It's okay to iterate over array elements using the normal each for this one. :-)

# You should be able to handle "mixed" arrays. For instance: [1, [2], [3, [4]]].

# Fibonacci
